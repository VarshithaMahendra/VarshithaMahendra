## ðŸ’¡ About Me

I'm an embedded systems developer with a solid foundation in hardware-software integration, specializing in real-time monitoring, sensor interfacing, and microcontroller-based automation. I thrive in low-level programming environments where performance, reliability, and timing precision are critical. My academic and hands-on experience spans across 8051 and ARM microcontrollers, C/C++ development, and Linux-based workflows. I enjoy building systems that solve real-world problems â€” whether itâ€™s a tour planner in C or an industrial hazard detection unit.
